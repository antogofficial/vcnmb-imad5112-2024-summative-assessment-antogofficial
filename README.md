I have created a weather app which starts on an initial page and has a button which switches the user over to the splash page ![Screenshot (8)](https://github.com/antogofficial/vcnmb-imad5112-2024-summative-assessment-antogofficial/assets/160749174/e0bc8ea2-d6d6-4e62-b833-18b6409870ad) ![Screenshot (9)](https://github.com/antogofficial/vcnmb-imad5112-2024-summative-assessment-antogofficial/assets/160749174/0d60c78b-cf93-409d-9503-50e5ab9372d6) On this splash page are the declared values which are in the forms of a Spinner and a textview. ![Screenshot (10)](https://github.com/antogofficial/vcnmb-imad5112-2024-summative-assessment-antogofficial/assets/160749174/3069ff13-657b-4389-85bd-3a71ebf47bdd) The spinner is used to select the day of forcast that you would like to view as the user.

I have made use of arrays to store all the data within the weather app, to store data such as the days of the week and temperatures. ![Screenshot (11)](https://github.com/antogofficial/vcnmb-imad5112-2024-summative-assessment-antogofficial/assets/160749174/83345db6-8a04-422a-b3aa-95cdb0955e6d) ![Screenshot (12)](https://github.com/antogofficial/vcnmb-imad5112-2024-summative-assessment-antogofficial/assets/160749174/a807ca2c-90ce-4ba5-98af-a990c59cf2ef)
