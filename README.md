I have created a weather app which starts on an initial page and has a button which switches the user over to the splash page ![Screenshot (8)](https://github.com/antogofficial/vcnmb-imad5112-2024-summative-assessment-antogofficial/assets/160749174/e0bc8ea2-d6d6-4e62-b833-18b6409870ad) On this splash page are the declared values which are in the forms of a Spinner and a textview. The spinner is used to select the day of forcast that you would like to view as the user
